# sdui-forms

This is basically just a custom unstyled (uniforms)[https://uniforms.tools] theme (with classNames added for validation errors and react-functional-select), a wrapper to
easily use forms in a modal, some prebuild login/signin forms and a Button Component
that calls a MeteorMethod on Click and optionally shows a confirmation modal and
success and error toasts (with toastify) and a spinning icon while waiting for the result.
